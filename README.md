Winner of Challenge 1: Kinase Inhibitor Selectivity :))

# To run this:

Sorry for this being split into 3 notebooks. I cannot code.

1. Run `training.ipynb` to save the models.
2. Run `results.ipynb` to run the test data.
3. Run `selectivity_scores.ipynb`with the generated `csv` files to generate selectivity scores.

# The slides files:
`PharmaHacks Presentation.pptx` (PowerPoint)

`PharmaHacks Presentation.pdf` (PDF)
